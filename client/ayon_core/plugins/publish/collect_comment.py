"""Collect comment and add option to enter comment per instance.

Combination of plugins. One define optional input for instances in Publisher
UI (CollectInstanceCommentDef) and second cares that each instance during
collection has available "comment" key in data (CollectComment).

Plugin 'CollectInstanceCommentDef' define "comment" attribute which won't be
filled with any value if instance does not match families filter or when
plugin is disabled.

Plugin 'CollectComment' makes sure that each instance in context has
available "comment" key in data which can be set to 'str' or 'None' if is not
set.
- In case instance already has filled comment the plugin's logic is skipped
- The comment is always set and value should be always 'str' even if is empty

Why are separated:
- 'CollectInstanceCommentDef' can have specific settings to show comment
    attribute only to defined families in publisher UI
- 'CollectComment' will run all the time

Todos:
    The comment per instance is not sent via farm.
